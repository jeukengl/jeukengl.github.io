          <p>Outside of work and school, I enjoy staying active, playing the piano, and giving back to my community.
            I started playing tennis at the age of seven. Today, though I do not play professional tennis anymore,
            I still manage to play at least three hours per week. I also enjoy playing the piano and writing music.
            When I was 14 years old, I taught myself to play the piano by ear and every since, I have been writing
            my own music. Today, I have written over 40 songs. Lastly, I love giving back to my community. I volunteer
            regularly in anyway possible. Whether it be teaching children tennis or introducing young children to the
            concept of Computer Science, I try to give back as much as I possibly can.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Bio</h2>
          <p>I was born in the West African Country of Cameroon on May 26th, 1996. My family and I moved to the United States when I was two
            years old to flee the political unrest at the time. In 2015, I became a citizen and in May 2018, I will earn my Bachelor’s of Science
            in Computer Science. I consider it an amazing advantage to have been raised and educated in the United States. Because of my
            upbringing, I understand the importance of continuous hard work and perseverance.
          </p>
          <p>When I was seven years old, I started playing tennis and I fell in love with sport shortly thereafter. For the next
            nine years, I would travel across the country playing tournaments. I was fortunate enough to visit 37 states and Canada.
            I have had the opportunity to meet a variety of people from different countries across the world. I believe that this
            experience has shaped into the person I am today.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Spring 2013, I started my collegiate tennis career at Clemson University in Clemson, SC. After eight months at Clemson,
            I decided to begin my professional career. I reached a high rank of #533 in the world and competed in prestigious tournaments
            such as the U.S. Open. In March 2016, I was seriously injured with rotator cuff tendonitis which put a dampener on my
            tennis career. Thus, I put my focus on academics. </p>
          <p>
            In August 2014, I turned my hobby of tinkering with computers into a non-profit organization. Global Sigma is an
            organization that I cofounded with my brother a senior at the University of Miami, and my uncle a professor at the Rochester
            Institute of Technology. The mission of Global Sigma is to help underprivileged students obtain the technology they need to
            be successful in school such as laptops, printers, and scanners. Through our organization, we receive old electronic devices
            from donors and refurbish them for these students to use. For the past two years, I’ve worked alongside my brother as the
            Vice President of Global Sigma and through this experience, I’ve gained a deeper appreciation for the use of technology as
            a tool to help those less fortunate.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2016, I participated in an internship funded by the Department of Defense and the National Science
            Foundation located at Florida International University (FIU). During this internship, I learned many valuable skills
            such as the ability to create a mobile application via Android Studios. This particular project was initially daunting
            because I had never attempted such a task before. I had to problem solve quickly and efficiently to complete the tasks
            at hand. The application I created alongside PhD student Abdur Bin Shahid, was able to generate an algorithm that can
            be used to increase user location privacy on Location Based Services via spatial obfuscation. This research project
            generated a paper final titled: Privacy Preserving Voronoi Cells which was submitted to the International Conference
            on Computing, Networking, and Communications (ICNC). The paper was eventually published and I had the privilege to
            present my paper at a conference in Silicon Valley in January of 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2017, I participated in an internship funded by the National Science Foundation at North Carolina
            State University (NCSU) in Raleigh, NC. I worked alongside a Computer Science graduate student at NCSU as well as
            with my faculty mentor, Dr. Laurie Williams. Our research topic was The Discrepancies Between Security Breaches and
            Policy. The goal of our research was to refine security policies and regulations based on identified gaps/holes
            with respect to the security breaches. I worked mainly on creating an automated process for security breach refinement.
            We submitted our work to the ISE (International Conference on Software Engineering) ’18 and it is currently pending acceptance.
          </p>
          <p>

            Aside, from my research experience, I also have industry work experience. During my senior year at the University of Florida,
            I was accepted into the Integrated Product and Process Design (IPPD) program. In this program, I am assigned to a company
            to developed software with a team of five other talented engineers. Our sponsor company for this project is Siemens Energy.
            Our goal is to develop a mobile and desktop application to manage the process of efficiently adding metadata to gas turbine
            field service hardware images. The image sources may come from digital cameras, including cellphones and tablets, and
            specialized equipment such as borescopes, infrared cameras, and X-Ray systems. The product is set to be completed and
            delivered to Siemens Energy by April 2018.
